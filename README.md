# Level 1: Very Simple

Print numbers from 1 to 10.
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.

Check even or odd.
Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

Reverse a string.
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

# Level 2: Slightly Harder

FizzBuzz Problem.
Print numbers from 1 to 50.

If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
Otherwise, print the number.
Find the largest number in an array.
Write a function to find the largest number in an array.
Example:
Input: [3, 7, 1, 9, 4]
Output: 9

Count vowels in a string.
Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
Example:
Input: "javascript"
Output: 3

# Level 3: Moderate

Palindrome Check.
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
Example:
Input: "madam"
Output: true

Remove duplicates from an array.
Write a function to remove duplicates from an array.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Sort an array in ascending order.
Write a function to sort an array in ascending order without using the built-in sort() method.
Example:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# Level 4: Hard

Find the first non-repeating character.
Write a function to find the first character in a string that does not repeat.
Example:
Input: "javascript"
Output: "j"

Find the sum of all elements in a nested array.
Write a function that takes a nested array (array of arrays) and returns the sum of all elements.
Example:
Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
Output: 15

Generate Fibonacci sequence.
Write a function to generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Example:
Input: 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

# Level 5: Advanced

Check if two strings are anagrams.
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order).
Example:
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

Find the missing number in an array.
Write a function to find the missing number in an array of numbers from 1 to n.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 4, 5] (Missing 3)
Output: 3

Flatten a nested array.
Write a function to flatten a nested array (convert [[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]]] into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
Example:
Input: [[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
